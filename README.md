# Tourism_rating and Recommendation system

Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze tourism data to gain insights into tourist behaviors, preferences, and popular tourist spots, and to develop a recommendation system that suggests tourist spots based on user ratings and current tourist locations.

Steps Involved:

 1.Data Import and Preliminary Inspection:

  Task: Import all datasets and perform initial checks.
    I. Check for Missing Values and Duplicates:
      Identify any missing data and duplicates in the datasets.
    II. Remove Anomalies:
      Clean the data by removing or handling anomalies such as outliers or inconsistent data entries.

 2.User Group Exploration:

  Objective: Understand the demographics and origins of the users providing tourism ratings.
    I. Analyze Age Distribution:
      Explore the age distribution of users visiting various tourist spots and rating them.
    II. Identify Tourist Origins:
      Determine the regions or cities from where most of the users (tourists) are coming.

 3.Exploration of Locations and Categories:

  Objective: Delve into the specifics of the tourist spots and their categorizations.
    I. Different Categories of Tourist Spots:
      Identify and categorize the different types of tourist spots available.
    II. Tourism Suitability:
      Determine the type of tourism (e.g., nature, adventure, historical) that each location is most famous for.
    III. Best City for Nature Enthusiasts:
      Identify the best city for a nature enthusiast based on the available tourist spots.

 4.Combined Data Analysis:

  Objective: Merge the data to gain a comprehensive understanding of tourist spots and user ratings.
    I. Identify Most Loved Spots:
      Use the combined data to figure out the most loved tourist spots and identify the city with the most popular tourist attractions.
    II. Favorite Categories:
      Analyze which category of places (e.g., historical, cultural, amusement parks) are most liked by users in Indonesia.

 5.Recommendation System Development:

  Objective: Build a collaborative filtering model to recommend tourist spots.
    I. Collaborative Filtering Model:
      Develop a recommendation system that suggests other places to visit based on the current tourist location (place name).



Outcome:
The project will provide valuable insights into tourism trends, user preferences, and popular tourist destinations. Additionally, the recommender system will enhance user experience by suggesting personalized tourist spots, thereby aiding in better planning of trips.
